# Homepage Design Document

## Overview

The homepage design will transform the current minimal Home.jsx component into a comprehensive, professional landing page that serves as the main entry point for the Secure.ai cybersecurity laws documentation application. The design will leverage the existing dark theme (slate-900 background) and gradient styling patterns established in the Landing.jsx component while creating a distinct homepage experience focused on the application's core functionality.
